### Patch Changes

- 5e01789: **Breaking (pre-1.0)**: removed `defineI18n`, `defineCache`, `defineQueue`, `defineRealtime`, `defineEventBus` and `defineKeyRouting`

  A module is enabled in exactly two ways, and that is a universal rule of the framework: its **decorator** for the declarative API (`@I18n()`, `@Cache()`, `@Queue()`, `@Realtime()`, `@EventBus()`, `@KeyRouting()`), or its **blueprint** handed to the app manifest for the imperative one, `defineStoneApp(handler, options, [i18nBlueprint])`, which is the exact counterpart of `@StoneApp(options, [i18nBlueprint])`. These six helpers were a third path that enabled nothing: each returned an unwrapped configuration fragment (`{ i18n: … }`), and the pattern every README and docs page showed for them, `defineConfig(defineX({...}))`, **configured nothing at all**. `defineConfig` expects a function or an object carrying `configure`; handed a fragment it falls back to an empty `configure`, silently. That is what made the i18n catalogs never load.

  **Migration**: enable with the decorator or the blueprint, and configure with `blueprint.set`:

  ```ts
  // before (compiled, ran, configured nothing)
  export const AppConfig = defineConfig(defineCache({ default: 'redis', stores: [...] }))

  // after: enable on the manifest, configure with blueprint.set
  export const Application = defineStoneApp(handler, { name: 'my-app' }, [cacheBlueprint])

  export const AppConfig = defineConfig((blueprint) => blueprint.set('stone.cache', {
    default: 'redis',
    stores: [...]
  }))
  ```

  READMEs and documentation pages are updated accordingly. `defineJobHandler` and `defineKeyRoute` are untouched: they declare a module, not a configuration bucket, and keep their imperative role next to `@JobHandler` and `@KeyRoute`.

- f6d9fe4: fix(build): published declarations carry explicit `.js` extensions

  Our sources are bundler-style (extensionless relative imports) and `tsc` reproduces what they wrote. In a published ESM package with an `exports` map, a consumer on `moduleResolution: nodenext` cannot resolve those specifiers, so the types of everything they re-export become **invisible**. The reported symptom was misleading: `error TS2305: Module '"@stone-js/use-react"' has no exported member 'useContainer'`, which reads as "the hook does not exist" rather than "the module was not resolved". A pilot project hit it on `@stone-js/use-react` and worked around it with `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, which is right for bundled code but wrong for a pure Node ESM consumer.

  The shared build now rewrites relative specifiers in every emitted declaration (`<file>.js`, or `<dir>/index.js` for a directory), and the generated barrel emits them the same way. `@stone-js/use-view`, which carries its own rollup config, was wired to the same plugin.

  Verified across 635 declaration files: zero extensionless relative imports, and a `moduleResolution: nodenext` consumer importing `useContainer` / `useBlueprint` typechecks clean where it previously reported 138 errors. A `pnpm run check:dts` guard runs in CI right after the build so this cannot regress, including for a package that grows its own build config.

## Unreleased

### Refactor

- gateways now route through the kernel via the light key-router (`@stone-js/router`). `@RealtimeGateway`/`@On*` are aliases of `@KeyHandler`/`@OnKey`; the internal `RealtimeRouter` is removed. Gateway methods now receive `(payload, event)`; read the connection with the new `connectionOf(event)` helper.

### Miscellaneous Chores

- the key-router primitive moved into `@stone-js/router`; import `KeyRouter` / `createKeyDecorator` / `collectKeyHandlers` from `@stone-js/router` (was `@stone-js/key-router`).
