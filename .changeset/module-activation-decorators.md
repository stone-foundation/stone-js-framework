feat: `@Auth()`, `@Authz()`, `@Telemetry()` and `@Validation()`, so every module has its two activation paths

A Stone.js module is enabled in exactly two ways, and every module must expose both: its **decorator** for the declarative API, or its **blueprint** handed to the application manifest for the imperative one. An audit of every package found 27 modules exposing both and four exposing only the blueprint. These are those four.

```ts
@Auth({ secret: getString('JWT_SECRET') })
@StoneApp({ name: 'my-app' })
export class Application {}

// or, imperatively
export const Application = defineStoneApp({ name: 'my-app' }, [authBlueprint])
```

Each decorator clones its blueprint and overrides only its options bucket, the way `@I18n()` and `@Cors()` do: the blueprint stays the single source of truth for what the module declares, so the two paths cannot drift apart, and each decorated application gets its own copy instead of sharing the exported constant.

**Breaking (pre-1.0), `@stone-js/telemetry`**: the service class `Telemetry` is renamed **`TelemetryManager`**, freeing the bare name for the decorator, exactly as `CacheManager`, `RealtimeManager` and `I18nManager` do. Rollup was already dropping one of the two `Telemetry` exports as a conflicting re-export. Update `Telemetry` to `TelemetryManager` where you import the service; the container aliases `telemetry` and `Telemetry` are unchanged, so `constructor ({ telemetry })` keeps working.

**The documented activation was also wrong.** Three places taught `blueprint.set(authBlueprint)` from inside a `@Configuration`, which merges a fragment into the store rather than registering a module: the `@stone-js/auth` README, the website Auth page, and the `stateless-auth` blog starter. All three now enable the module on the application and keep the configuration for what it is for. The four READMEs and the Auth, Authorization and Validation pages document both paths; `authz` and `validation` documented no activation at all, and `telemetry` already documented a `@Telemetry()` decorator that did not exist.

The two remaining blueprints without a decorator are deliberate: `stoneCliBlueprint` is the CLI's own application, and `testAdapterBlueprint` is consumed by `createTestApp()`. Neither is ever declared on an application class.

**Also fixed, `@stone-js/node-cli-adapter`**: `@NodeConsole()` merged its options **into** the exported `nodeConsoleAdapterBlueprint` and handed that very object to every decorated class, so a second application built alongside the first inherited its options and the constant stayed dirty for the rest of the process. It now clones before merging, as every other adapter decorator already did.
