- f6d9fe4: fix(build): published declarations carry explicit `.js` extensions

  Our sources are bundler-style (extensionless relative imports) and `tsc` reproduces what they wrote. In a published ESM package with an `exports` map, a consumer on `moduleResolution: nodenext` cannot resolve those specifiers, so the types of everything they re-export become **invisible**. The reported symptom was misleading: `error TS2305: Module '"@stone-js/use-react"' has no exported member 'useContainer'`, which reads as "the hook does not exist" rather than "the module was not resolved". A pilot project hit it on `@stone-js/use-react` and worked around it with `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, which is right for bundled code but wrong for a pure Node ESM consumer.

  The shared build now rewrites relative specifiers in every emitted declaration (`<file>.js`, or `<dir>/index.js` for a directory), and the generated barrel emits them the same way. `@stone-js/use-view`, which carries its own rollup config, was wired to the same plugin.

  Verified across 635 declaration files: zero extensionless relative imports, and a `moduleResolution: nodenext` consumer importing `useContainer` / `useBlueprint` typechecks clean where it previously reported 138 errors. A `pnpm run check:dts` guard runs in CI right after the build so this cannot regress, including for a package that grows its own build config.
