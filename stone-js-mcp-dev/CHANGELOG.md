### Patch Changes

- c971168: fix: authentication reads the header, and a contract describes the API

  Six defects reported from a pilot application, each reproduced before it was touched.

  - `@stone-js/auth` read the bearer token with `event.get('Authorization')`, and that accessor deliberately refuses to read headers, because it also reads the query string and the body. So the real header was ignored, every request stayed anonymous, and `?Authorization=` would have been read in its place. It reads `getHeader` now.
  - `@stone-js/openapi` documented every endpoint under `/`: a route's `path` is the pathname of the event it is answering, and no event is bound while generating a document. It reads the declared template, translates `:id` into `{id}`, declares the parameters the template requires, and publishes both paths for an optional segment.
  - A Zod 4 schema converted to `{}`, an empty JSON Schema meaning "anything", so every documented body and response was silently unconstrained. A schema that can describe itself is now asked to.
  - An explicit `contract:` block replaced everything derived, so documenting one `404` deleted the derived success response. It merges instead, per status, and a declared success status replaces the derived one rather than joining it.
  - The derived success status was always `200`, even for a handler answering `201`. The response decorators now record the status they build, so the document cannot contradict the code it came from.
  - `@stone-js/resources`: every `@ApiResource` the container resolved crashed on `checker`, an optional dependency read straight off the container, which resolves any name it is asked for and throws when nothing is bound.
  - `@stone-js/core`: `@Middleware` could only ever declare kernel middleware, so a middleware that reads the matched route could be registered from a blueprint but not from the decorator. `layer: 'app' | 'kernel' | 'router'` closes that, `global` keeps working.

  Packaging: `@stone-js/i18n`, `@stone-js/mcp-dev`, `@stone-js/openapi` and `@stone-js/use-react-native` published types referencing `@stone-js/cli` while declaring it as a dev dependency only. It is an optional peer now, so an application is never asked to resolve a package nobody told it about.

## 0.8.10

### Patch Changes

- 35c159b: Resources declare what leaves as a schema, and hold themselves to it.

  A projection written as code answered "what does this endpoint return?" only to someone who read it
  and trusted it: nothing checked it, nothing documented it, and a field added to the model later leaked
  because a mapping was not updated. A resource now declares a **schema**, in whatever dialect the
  application already validates input with, and that one declaration does three jobs — it _is_ the
  projection (what it does not describe is not exposed), it validates the response before it is sent,
  and `@stone-js/openapi` derives the output contract from it.

  - `schema(context)` is the contract. `fragments(context)` names subsets a caller may select through a
    configurable query parameter (`?view=summary` by default), each a documented contract of its own
    rather than an ad-hoc filter.
  - `data(model, context)` is an optional, asynchronous hook resolved from the container: fetch a
    relation, translate a label, compute a total. Whatever it returns is what the schema validates.
  - `item`, `collection` and `response` are asynchronous. The previous synchronous path turned an async
    projection into `{}` without a word.
  - A breach raises `ResourceContractError` naming the field that failed. It fires on a genuine breach,
    never on a difference, since a schema strips what it does not describe. `onViolation: 'warn'` trades
    integrity for availability, explicitly.
  - The context now carries the authenticated principal and the event, so a resource deciding what a
    caller may see no longer has to be told by the handler.

  **Fixes a defect that made route-declared resources unusable with a response decorator.**
  `@JsonHttpResponse(201)` wraps the method itself, so by the time route middleware ran the handler had
  already produced a response; projecting that object produced an empty payload and dropped the status.
  The payload is now shaped in place, and the status, headers and everything else the handler chose are
  left alone.

  Also fixed, all found by consumers rather than by us:

  - `@ValidationSchema` was **invisible to TypeScript**: the barrel exported an interface and a decorator
    of the same name, and TypeScript drops a name two `export *` both provide. The interface is now
    `NativeSchema`, matching the `isNativeSchema` guard that already existed.
  - `@stone-js/auth`'s `AuthorizationError` is now `InsufficientScopeError`. It is thrown for a missing
    scope, and it shared a name with `@stone-js/authz`'s error for a policy denial, so an application
    mapping errors had to map two identical names from two packages.
  - The auth documentation described an `Authenticator` with `authenticate(event)` that was never
    shipped; it now documents `resolveUser`, which is the real extension point, and `event.getUser()`
    rather than `event.get('user')` — the principal travels through a resolver, so the generic accessor
    never reached it. The same mistake was in this module's own code.
  - Two decorator examples showed options that do not exist (`@Validation({ abortEarly })`,
    `@Authz({ abilities })`); they now show `schemas` and `resolveAbility`.

## 0.8.9

### Patch Changes

- fe49d7e: Correct the MCP knowledge base so shipped queue, cache, i18n, realtime, and cloud-file modules are no longer reported as planned gaps, and guard the list against future workspace drift.
- e149263: fix: `.mcp.json` launches the CLI through `npx`, and vendor cycles stop flooding the build

  - **`@stone-js/mcp-dev`**: `stone mcp --init` wrote `{ "command": "stone", "args": ["mcp"] }`. Since `@stone-js/cli` is a project dev dependency, the bare `stone` only resolves with a global install, so the server an agent spawned failed with ENOENT on a normal project. The entry now goes through `npx`, which finds the project-local binary first and a global one otherwise.
  - **`@stone-js/cli`**: circular-dependency warnings coming from `node_modules` are now filtered on every build path, not just one. A React app bundles its dependencies into the SSR build (`ssr.noExternal`), so reaching the MCP SDK printed around twenty warnings from `zod` and `zod-to-json-schema` on an otherwise successful build, which reads as a failure. Cycles in your own code still warn, because those are actionable.
  - **`@stone-js/config-source`**: the optional `js-yaml` peer floor moves to `^4.3.1`, the patched line for the quadratic-CPU advisory.

- 298cff2: `stone mcp` describes the application you are actually running.

  It is a console command, so a blueprint it resolves for itself is the one a **console** boot produces:
  its adapters, its response type and every platform-conditional contribution belong to a different
  application than the one under `stone dev`. Everything platform-independent was right — routes,
  providers, the kernel handler — and everything else described an app that does not exist, without
  saying so.

  The running application now publishes its resolved configuration to `.stone/app-context.json`, and the
  MCP server reads it. A new `stone_describes` tool says which application the answers describe and how
  the server knows, so a fallback is visible rather than silently wrong.

  **Dev tooling only, with nothing to declare in your application.** `@McpDev()`, `mcpDevBlueprint` and
  `defineMcpDev` are **removed**: introspection is a development concern, and a development tool in an
  application's module graph makes a production build depend on a package the app does not need, for a
  feature nobody uses in production.

  `npm i -D @stone-js/mcp-dev` is now the whole setup. The CLI auto-discovers the plugin, which registers
  `stone mcp` and — on a development build only — injects the publishing hook. Options move to
  `stone.config.mjs` under `mcpDev` (server name, instructions, your own tools, `publishContext`), where
  the rest of the build is already configured. The browser build goes too: it existed to keep an app-side
  decorator inert in a SPA, and there is no longer anything app-side to neutralise.

  A file rather than a dev endpoint, deliberately: the Blueprint is assembled once before the first event
  and then read, so publishing it at boot _is_ the value. No port to discover, no route added to an
  application, no token to protect, and it works for a CLI or an edge context with no HTTP surface. What
  genuinely moves at run time is a different question, for a different tool.

  Two defects found on the way and fixed here. `@stone-js/cli` rewrote plugin-contributed relative
  specifiers against `.stone/tmp`, where a production entry lives but a development entry does not, so
  any plugin contributing a module was silently unresolvable under `stone dev` — `@stone-js/i18n`'s
  catalogue injection included. And `@stone-js/openapi`'s CLI plugin shipped with no default export
  (multi-entry re-exports named exports only), so first-party auto-discovery never loaded it at all.

- 298cff2: Publish the arguments every dev tool reads, so an agent can actually pass them.

  No tool declared an `inputSchema`, so each one was advertised as taking no arguments and the MCP
  client dropped them before sending. Five handlers read arguments and all five received `{}`:
  `stone_search` answered `[]` for every query, making a fully populated knowledge base look empty,
  while `stone_concept` and `stone_config` always fell into their "list everything" branch and the
  report tools opened issues titled `Bug report` with an empty body. The handlers were right; the
  advertised contract was not, and the documentation described the arguments the code never published.

  `zod` is now a declared dependency rather than a transitive one, `inputSchema` is typed as a Zod
  shape instead of a loose record, and a tool without one is registered with no schema at all rather
  than an empty one.

- f6d9fe4: fix(build): published declarations carry explicit `.js` extensions

  Our sources are bundler-style (extensionless relative imports) and `tsc` reproduces what they wrote. In a published ESM package with an `exports` map, a consumer on `moduleResolution: nodenext` cannot resolve those specifiers, so the types of everything they re-export become **invisible**. The reported symptom was misleading: `error TS2305: Module '"@stone-js/use-react"' has no exported member 'useContainer'`, which reads as "the hook does not exist" rather than "the module was not resolved". A pilot project hit it on `@stone-js/use-react` and worked around it with `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, which is right for bundled code but wrong for a pure Node ESM consumer.

  The shared build now rewrites relative specifiers in every emitted declaration (`<file>.js`, or `<dir>/index.js` for a directory), and the generated barrel emits them the same way. `@stone-js/use-view`, which carries its own rollup config, was wired to the same plugin.

  Verified across 635 declaration files: zero extensionless relative imports, and a `moduleResolution: nodenext` consumer importing `useContainer` / `useBlueprint` typechecks clean where it previously reported 138 errors. A `pnpm run check:dts` guard runs in CI right after the build so this cannot regress, including for a package that grows its own build config.

## 0.8.8

### Patch Changes

- d5bee74: docs(mcp-dev): centre the setup on `npx stone mcp --init`

  The README told you to start the server yourself, which does nothing useful for a stdio transport: the agent spawns its own child process and talks to it over that process's stdin/stdout, so a server launched in a terminal has no channel to the agent. Setup is now the single `--init` command, with the manual run documented only as a way to read the stderr logs while debugging.

  Commands are shown as `npx stone …` since `@stone-js/cli` is a project dev dependency, and the alternative (a global install) is stated.

  Also removes `stone_docs` from the documented tool list and from the Agent Skills: that tool does not exist, so an agent following the skills was calling a name the server never advertised.
